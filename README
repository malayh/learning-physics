# Learning Physics
This is a project that I wanted to do for a long time. I have an engineering degree, but I don't know physics and mathematics. I can't live with that 
So this project is to learn physics and implement a progressively more complex physics engine from scratch.

# Roadmap
Gemini created a roadmap for me: https://g.co/gemini/share/7ea8d0c57202
I will add more details here as I progress.
